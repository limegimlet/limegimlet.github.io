The good news is that since Strade Bianche is my fitness seems to have jumped up a notch, if the graph in my [StravistiX]{:target="_blank"} extension from Chrome is to believed. There's been a few other signs - steady improvements (and a few PRs) on local climbs compared to last fall, and average speed for my longer rides has been ticking up.

The flipside of getting fitter is it looks like I need to up my training volume if I want to spend any time in the "optimal" zone. 'Optimal' refers to the amount of fatigue to train through, as defined by some dude named Coggan who all kinds of endurance experts refer to. Too little fatigue while training tells your body there's no need to get stronger - coasting, essentially. Too much fatigue ('Overload') and you put yourself at risk for injury.

*Fitness is in orange, fatigue is light grey. Ever since last September, I've been trying to keep fatigue in check, and no suprise haven't had any major injuries. Of course, replacing running with biking also helps ;).*


[I started using this extension last year, but mostly to gloat at my rising fitness curve. I conveniently ignored the spiky fatigue line. When I injured my back last September, I went back and looked at my history: sure enough, the biggest peaks in fatigue almost-perfectly predicted my injuries for the past 18 months. So now I pay attention.]

To be honest, I'd already noticed this even before SB. So I'd augment the 3 workouts/week with a long Sunday ride. But since I live in the dead-center of Paris, it takes a while to get into worthwhile riding territory so Sunday rides would last 4-5 hours,  doubling my weekly volume with one ride.

Then on Monday I'd feel like I'd been run over by a truck.

So now I'm trying to balance things out a bit, by increasing the number of days on the trainer from 3 to 4, upping the workout length for a few of those rides. As for Sunday, I'll try to go back to what I do back when coming back from injury, and take the train into the Vallée de la Chevreuse. Cuz if I'm going be outside, I want it to be pretty, dammit, and not spend it riding through Conforama parking lots.
