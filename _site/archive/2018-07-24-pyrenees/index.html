      <p>Prologue:</p>

<p>Day 0:</p>

<p>It’s a grand depart weekend, and Montparnasse Station is packed. So is the car of our train, including the bike spaces we had reserved at 15eur a pop. The space was filled with a mountain of suitcases. Since our bikes literally had nowhere to go, we created a nice bottleneck for people trying to board as we started to move the luggage. Slight brouhaha ensued, while we explained that we had paid for those bike spaces and that most luggage would fit under the seats. No controlleurs in sight.</p>

<p>For reminder of trip, whenever train stopped Bettina would stand in front of our bikes, arms akimbo, daring anyone to slip any more bags around or, God forbid, on them.</p>

<p>Afternoon was more relaxing. From our hotel ut was an easy coast to a small beach, quieter than the main one in St-Jean-de-Luz. The water was warm, like a tepid bath, with a sandy bottom and no seaweed. Bliss.</p>

<p>[bikini pics]</p>

<p>Day 1:</p>

<p>Very motivated this morning, not just because it’s the first day, but also because tonight is the World Cup finals, and France is playing!!! The game starts at 16h50, and we had a 120km and one nasty steep col to climb before we’d reach a TV, so we needed an early start.</p>

<p>The route looked mostly flat until the big climb in the last 30k. In reality, it was a lot of little <em>murs</em>. The air is humid. The landscape, green and hunchbacked.</p>

<p>By lunchtime the once-distant mountains are now in our face. So is the sun. Had a very mediocre lunch. Also a rather quiet one: we do not have really a common language. 2 of 6 are weak in English, one has absolutely no French, another has absolutely no German and 2 others only a basic understanding.</p>

<p>After lunch B goes wiggling away in TT position down the flat highway, with A sticking to her wheel. I keep things mellow, wary of the first 2 km of 9-10% grades in midday heat and post-lunch digestion.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is like the Etape all over again. P with his backpack and spare tools begins walking by the 2nd KM, I suggest stopping instead for water &amp; food breaks. 8 km is a long way to walk uphill. I instead took my usual back-stretch stops, which I also used to eat and drink.</p>

<p>I plod on, dimly aware of spectacular views but not caring. All I’m thinking about is a break at by the lake and its snack bar around km5. Around KM5 the road flattens, I can see A in the distance ( no sign of B). Around every bend I expect to see a lake and/or snack bar. But I don’t. Grumpiness ensues.</p>

<p>4 km later what I do see is a col sign, the first of the trip. But all I care about now is the bloody snack bar. Magic 1.5km of descent and there it is (although if there was a lake, it’s now dried up), with Bettina smugly smiling, telling us she’s been here 20 minutes. Apparently she zig zagged the steep bits. Duh! Something I hadn’t even thought of a) zig-zagging is usually a cycling no-no, and b) it would have been impossible with the volume of riders at Etape, but on these empty roads it would have been totally doable. And while zig-zagging certainly docks points for style, it beats having to stop.</p>

<p>In the end, we made it to the 2nd col shortly after the WC final started. From there it was a 12k descent to our gite, where the bar was packed. A &amp; I plunked ourselves on the floor directly in front of TV and with baited breath watched France beat Croatia to win only their second World Cup, ever.</p>

<p>V showed up before end of game: apparently R had cycled back down to stay with her, and she eventually hitched a ride up. She was infinitely grateful R, and she’d need to ride by herself, not wanting to slow us down, nor put pressure on herself to keep up. So much of the evening to was spent discussing options for V - rent a car? Didn’t bring license. Use trains? Hmmmm, that could work sometimes, as long as they were indeed trains and not just buses.</p>

<h1 id="day-2">Day 2</h1>

<p>As forecasted, it was raining steadily when we woke up. Today the major col was the beautiful Col d’Aubisque: too bad it would  be shrouded in clouds.</p>

<p>The solution for V was for her to ride to Lourdes (an easy 30k mostly downhill) and find a bike shop that could replace her 28 cassette with a 32. A, who didn’t relish riding in rain and is native French, offered to come with her.</p>

<p>The other 4 of us set off, with R not very happy about the rain and putting on as many protective garments as possible. Personally, with the rain being so warm, I found it pretty soothing.</p>

<p>The riding was considerably easier than yesterday, with hills having more reasonable 4-5% grades and there weren’t too many of them.</p>

<p>Lunch options were around km60, and for the 15km preceding that we were following contour lines of a low mountain. It was frustrating because around every bend when the road started heading down I braced for a long descent into the valley I could see below, in spite of the fog, but it would just roll back up. The road was occasionally marred by a fallen tree or a mini-mudslide. I noticed the Germany contingent did not trust riding through the debris, and would dismount to go over mud or twigs.</p>

<p>Finally, we descended into the valley, and turned into the first town we saw in search of lunch. Our timing was perfect: as we rolled into the main square, the skies opened. We traipsed into the little Logis de France and our sodden, lycra-clad group stopped conversation dead. Seems the resto was the cantine for locals.</p>

<p>The food was extremely mediocre, but it was cheap. Best yet, our server was very sympa. She warned us and the 2 other cyclists that later joined that the Col d’Ausbique was closed due to a landslide a few weeks ago. They had made quick repairs so that the TdF could pass through next week, but she wasn’t sure if that work was finished yet. The tourist office confirmed her recommendation: bypass Col d’Ausbisque and take a circular detour to go up to the Col de Soulor, which was on our original route, downhill on the eastern slope pf Aubisque.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, P &amp; R not liking the rain at all, decided to check out Lourdes instead.</p>

<p>B &amp; I were determined to tackle a col today, especially since the sun came out after lunch. Our detour to the climb start was a lot lumpier than the morning’s ride, but offered spectacular views of the surrounding hills to the north and east, and the ominously clouded mountains to the west and south. We also got intermingled with cows being herded, with one cow decided to race us, much to the amusement of the farmer. Whether he was amused at the cow’s antics, or my obvious trepidation around cow with very big horns, was unclear.</p>

<p>The first 10k or so of the road to the col followed the river and was gentle 1-3% grades, a nice warm up. Everything was fogged over, so not much views but it was refreshing compared to yesterday.</p>

<p>In the process we moved from the Pyrenees Occidentales (Western Pyrenees) to Pyrenees Occitanes. Soon enough the official col sign appeared, telling us it was 12km to the col and this first km would have an average of 9%. Whee.</p>

<p>So the first few KMs of the climb proper were similar to yesterday’s, but again the overcast weather was a real boon. Also the grades were more consistent. And after a few KMs they calmed down into 6-8% grades, and that really made a difference: I could finally spin my legs in a somewhat smooth-ish fashion. I could keep up with B and even passed her a few times.</p>

<p>Around the 4k mark, though, my back started to complain and B ploughed ahead while I stopped to stretch. And take pics, because we could now see the valley opening up ahead of us. The sky was also clearing up too, so we could see the peaks around Aubisque and Soulor. It was beautiful and very motivating.</p>

<p>And the road was empty. I can’t even remember if any cars passed us during the 12k. Definitely no cyclists, and the only motorbikes I saw were parked, while their riders studied the map and contemplated routes.</p>

<p>When I joined B at the top for coffee in the de rigeur snack bar, we saw that the col d’Aubisque road was indeed open to cyclists and even motorbikes, as there was a steady trickle of the them going in both directions. So our long detour had been unnecessary. But it was so beautiful and empty that I didn’t mind at all.</p>

<p>The descent was fabulous, especially for B: the road was a silky strip of fresh ashphalt for the TdF and she zoomed down the hairpins. Me, not so much. While I’ve made big improvements in my descending these last few years, the open-ness &amp; the windiness of a true alpine descent still has me reaching for the brakes more than I’d like, especially if I’m tired.</p>

<p>The last 10k were flatter but still with a lot of bends, and the road still silky smooth. It was a fun ride and we had great timing: fat rain drops began to fall  just as we pulled into Argeles.</p>

<p>Day 3</p>

<p>No worries about rain today. We had a slight delay so P could pick up new brakes from a bike store that was conveniently around the corner from our hotel.</p>

<p>Today we were to tackle Tourmalet and Aspin. It was a gradual downhill for the first few KMs, and then an almost equally gradual uphill. I was dropped back from the other 5 when I noticed my HR creeping up. I hadn’t slept well and was feeling tired from the previous day. Of course it’s more efficient in a paceline, but if the pace still gets my HR higher than what I normally start off at, I preferred to opt for energy conservation.</p>

<p>Tourmalet</p>

<p>The road started gently, at 3-5% grades mostly in the shade and more or less still following the river. The road winds through a few small towns (not just villages). From Luc St Saveur, the views were almost immediate, which helped me immensely as legs were not warming up and not back was starting to complain so I began taking back breaks as soon as the grades hit 8-9% (early).</p>

<p>I hate to say it, but perhaps Cesar was right and I perhaps I should have saved myself for Tourmalet (but the climb to Soulor was gorgeous so really, I was happy to suck up the suck).</p>

<p>The climb is 19k, and around the midway point there’s a reprieve: the road not only flattens out along the river valley, but there’s a snack bar run by a Frenchman who is very intent on improving his English. There I found the rest of the crew (minus V of course). R was working on his sister’s back: he’s a physiotherapist, quite the boon for a bike tour. He worked on me next, and I immediately felt tension melt away.</p>

<p>After the break, I was spinning more easily but back still felt wierd. The road flattened again (for the last time) so I took a break to photograph sheep and the increasingly craggy views immediately above me. Passing the 2nd snack bar, the road became Sa Collabra-style hairpin-y, but steeper. There was also less shade, and I even bonked 2k from the col, but I was still in a good mood because, well, views. (And I’m also still convinced Gu gels beat any others, hands down).</p>

<p>At the top, the rest of the crew hung out for some group pics and A took a pic of me with the famous suffering naked dude statue. They’d been up there a while and were ready to search for lunch. I was still shaky from my bonk, and stayed up top for a glass of green tea. But my back was already feeling better.</p>

<p>The descent was susprisingly not steep for the first few KMs. It steepened to 10% just after La Mongie, which I later learned was where the group had stopped for lunch (I had assumed it would be dismissed as charmless and they’d stop further down). I tried pedalling a 100m or so back up then stopped. I noticed that all vehicles going up were either Vans or station wagons, and got a ride with the next one that passed me.</p>

<p>Lunch was surprisingly tasty (veggies and salmon) and was outside in the sun. We were all very dozy. Eventually we continued our descent, the air getting warmer and warmer. After 15k or so of descending, the route turned sharp right and began lazily heading upwards. It was hot, but the grades were low.</p>

<p>The gently undulating terrain lasted for 7k and then I saw the col sign telling me it was 5k to the top and this first km would be 8% and in the sun. So would the next couple of KMs but at least they were in the forest. It was not the most exciting climb, but I was grateful for the shade and the hairpins, which I find a nice way to break up a climb. And I only had to stop once or twice and that might have been more from the heat than my back. Overall I was feeling pretty pleased that I sur</p>

<p>The grades eased up noticeably in the last few KM. Around 2km from the top, a guy in yellow zoomed past me. Then, when I was 500m from the summit and could practically see the cows &amp; the col sign, he came back and pulled up alongside me:</p>

<p>“What’s your gear ratio?”</p>

<p>WTF kind of question is that during a ride? In your LBS, sure, or during coffee stop chit chat. He explained that a group was waiting at the top for their last rider.</p>

<p>More WTF? I knew P would not have finished much before as I had him in my sights for much of the climb. When I got to the top, now very grumpy, I learned that my gang didn’t send the lookout.</p>

<p>We met up with V at the top, and after a lot of selfies and cow pics, we descended and had cold drinks at the cute town. B did her best to chat up some Kiwis, as she’s looking for accommodations for doing the Tour Aratoroa next year. And she’s also looking for a boyfriend. Frenchwoman A was highly amused (envious?) of B’s blatantness, so un-French.</p>

<p>It was another 12k to Avajan, a gently undulating faux-plat. Even there V was having problems staying with the group.</p>

<p>Hotel was pretty basic, but the food was simple (no strangely decorated plates here) and generous. The terrine was very tasty. While waiting for dessert we stretched out backs using the support-pillars of the giant room, providing entertainment for the 2 other diners.</p>

<p>Day 4</p>

<p>Avajan to Oust</p>

<p>More gorgeous weather, and an early start. Was mentally prepared for very long, mostly gradual climb, so was quite surprised to see a ‘9k to col’ sign after less than 2k of riding. As I wheezed up, it dawned on me: the col profile was for one of the “offical” climb routes, but it overlapped our Day 3 &amp; 4 routes. Yesterday’s 12k of faux plat was actually the “true” start of the climb to Peyresoudre. Nice views started almost immediately, it was not too warm, and there was plenty of shade during the first steeper KMs. The final KMs was more gradual and winding: you could see the col ahead. I tried not to look that far. A soon managed to overtake me again, but I stayed close and was actually able to zip ahead in the last few hundred meters, 2nd to the col (B had long since arrived and was already eating the famous 50 centime crèpes).</p>

<p>The rest of the gang arrived, even V. We descended as a group to Bagnieres du Luzon, where we picked up food and V peeled off to find a detour around Col de Menthé.</p>

<p>The descent settled down to the 1-3% ranges and B got into her TT position. I refused to join the line behind her b/c I was convinced simply sticking to the wheel ahead would get my HR too high for comfort, knowing there was a tough climb ahead.  Soon the road turned, the grades turned slightly positive and the shade disappeared.</p>

<p>At the ‘Ascension du col de Menthé’ sign, A &amp; I ploughed ahead while the German contigent started shouting about being off route. I could see some elongated access road to the right. It was probably a glitch with the route planning. Whatever. No sense riding extra KMs if we’re already on the road to the col. It was very hot, I was very slow. Had to stop to loosen my shoes, as feet were already starting to hurt. A was already ahead, and soon enough the German contingent passed me as well. Then a lot of Brits (unloaded), who had a sag wagon. It was very hot. I had to stop. Not as often as on Tourmalet the day before, at least. As I glugged my energy drink and swapped at the giant insects landing on my sweaty limbs, I was dimly aware of craggy peaks in the distance, but didn’t pay them much mind. The road disappearing into the shady pine forest was more attention-getting.</p>

<p>The last few KMs were easier switchbacks among the pines, and there was even a bit of breeze. By the little restaurant at the top it was a bit of pandemonium: road works (the TDF was coming through the following week), motorcyclists, and even logging (it really felt like Canada). Had an excellent &amp; gigantic ‘salade fraicheur’ with organic river trout and sauteed courgettes. Really fantastic.</p>

<p>Quick descent and then it was up to Portet d’Aspet. Short but steep. Almost entirely in shade. At one point 4 of us were zig-zagging in sync up the 11% little <em>mur</em>. When we crossed over a little creek I decided to soak my shirt. Why suffer needlessly? Then at the top there was a water trough where we could soak our legs. Then down, down, down!</p>

<p>For the 12k before St Gisors we were in a paceline, which was fantastic because it was relatively dull highway. In St Gisors, the German boys started fretting about rain (WTF?) so they took off while we 3 ladies bought provisions and yet more Coke. The supermarket customers were obviously not used to seeing women cyclists and were getting a lot of once-overs.</p>

<p>The 3 of us rode the remaining 12k to Oust in a slow paceline alongside a river. The final few KMs went through sleepy villages and then we were in Oust and the Hotel de la Poste, the type of hotel where you expect to still find bidets in the bathrooms. The curtains were lace and there were bolsters on the bed. The room was giant, as was the bathroom, which indeed had a cavernous bath.</p>

<p>The skies opened up just after we got to our rooms, so I missed the chance to enjoy the outdoor pool.</p>

<p>It was perhaps the best hotel meal of the trip, and it looked like non-guests were dining there too. Were they locals? I wondered what would draw tourists out here. After dinner we had tisane and house-made meringues in the little salon. It felt like Balzac.</p>

<p>Day 5: Oust to Ax les Termes</p>

<p>As usual was up well before 7 am, so had a little wander around the village. It was very tidy, and there was a little chapel on the hill behind the hotel. Was that why the it was relatively popular? The tidiness and the buildings made me think we were now in Catalonia. Indeed, the Spanish border was only 15km away.</p>

<p>Breakfast was also fantastic, with homemade yoghurt!</p>

<p>My goal for the day was to get to Ax les Termes before 17h30, so I could spend 2 hours soaking in the thermal baths.</p>

<p>V was taking the long route to bypass Col d’Agnes, and would meet us (hopefully) on the 2nd col, Portet de Llers. We were in a slow paceline up to the beginning of Agnes.</p>

<p>We had our only 2 ‘mechanicals’ that day: my seat had sunk and then A had a flat. We tried to use a CO2 canister (which, fascinatingly, P had never heard of) but none of us could get the nozzle valve to open.</p>

<p>Then it was up and side to side. There were steep bits, but it with regular views to valley to the west of us, which kept me distracted. This time A got to the top first, then me shortly after, hurrah!</p>

<p>There was a 4k descent to the turn off for our next col. Just before the turn-off, however, was a snack bar. It didn’t look like much from the front - a sun-backed gravel area with tables under plastic umbrellas–but it was noon and who knew when we’d next find somewhere to eat. So we decided to lunch here, which is when we learned that lunch was served on the terrace out back, which had a view of a pond, cows, lots of grass and some nearby craggy peaks.</p>

<p>Lunch was another salade fraicheur, almost as good as yesterday and much more quiet. P briefly fell asleep.</p>

<p>The mini-climb to Portet de Lers was slow-going, but easy and in the alpine: I was in digestion mode. There wasn’t much at the top so down we went, regrouping at Vicdessos for another paceline through the busier highway. B was disappointed when I ask for not too crazy speed (‘but it’s downhill!’), but we still had another 80k to go and a long hot rolling traverse before we hit Ax les Termes, not to mention a few more climbs.</p>

<p>For the remainder of day we would parallel the route Nationale. It was hot indeed, slightly uphill and with a slight headwind. We stopped at another blessed water trough, the first of many in this area, to dunk helmets, jerseys, limbs etc into the lovely cold water.</p>

<p>Pas de Soûlambrie was short hot &amp; brutish. At the top, I really wanted to get to those <em>bains</em>. R was already motoring along, and I followed while the others took a more leisurely pace. It was a lot of up and down through gorgeous, immaculate but dead hamlets. There were views, but they left me unimpressed: too much like Canada (villages aside), a busy, industrial valley lined by steep slopes of unrelenting spruce trees, and nary a rocky peak to be seen. Zzzzz. Get me to the spa already.</p>

<p>The climb to the final col was the worst for me, even though it was only a 1% grade and mostly in the shade. It didn’t help that I was hangry. It felt endless, I was annoyed by the wall-to-wall spruce tree mountains. I had to stop several times, I was so hangry/bored…a toddler essentially. And the clock was ticking, so I took bypassed the final col (2 actually), and instead headed down to Ax les Termes on a fantastic D44 that was literally no wider than a bike path, which followed the contour line and cut across the steep open slope. It was exhilirating and my hanger immediately disappeared.</p>

<p>The magical road dropped me off 600m  from the bains. Woot! And it was 5:15 - I’d be able to enjoy a full 2 hours of soaking. Double woot! Also realized that our accommodations for the night weren’t actually <em>in</em> Ax les Thermes, but above it. Oh well, I’d worry about that later. I had a spa to enjoy!</p>

<p>Yes, I do seem rather obsessed about this spa. But it had that rare feature for a French spa: the option to simply soak in the pools for a few hours without having to purchase a pricey package of pampering, or be on a medically-prescribed 3-week <em>cure</em>. While common in Belgium and Germany, I’d never found it in France (or if it exists elsewhere, it is not mentioned in the spa websites).</p>

<p>The spa was all I had hoped for, with friendly staff that didn’t bat an eye at parking my bike by reception, since I didn’t have a lock. Near the end, I spotted V.</p>

<p>Afterwards, bit of a kerfuffle to make our way up the 6k to our B&amp;B. The town has one taxi, which wasn’t available. I started to bike up, and after 200m decided to consider hotels in town. Happily, the B&amp;B owners drove down in 2 cars to rescue us. They are used to shuttling guests.</p>

<p>Our host remembered the international group from the previous year - the morning group photo was even on their website! The host - Adam, I think - was exceptionally concerned that we had enough to eat. When not asking if we wanted more of X, he was emphasizing the difficulty of tomorrow’s first col. I had seen the profile, and while not a breeze, it was nothing like Tourmalet or Menthé. Especially since we were already so close to the summit.</p>

<p>Day 6</p>

<p>Ax les Thermes to Prades</p>

<p>Snooze, you lose. That’s the bizarre morale of today. When I woke up, the sun was streaming into our room and V was already dressed in her cycling kit. It was 8h30! The breakfast table was empty, and the rest of the gang was strapping their bags onto their saddles. I was gobsmacked: “You were going to leave without me?”</p>

<p>Apparently they had been unable to wake me up, decided I must be sick (!) and that they should just let me sleep.</p>

<p>I still get annoyed thinking about this, never mind writing it, so suffice it to say, I ended up riding solo that day. The first col was tough, mostly because it was hot.</p>

<p>As I approached the ski resort (deserted), the heat abated but the wind &amp; the grade picked up. Clouds rolled in. I reached the col, shrouded in mist, and no sign of the resident horses. I did encounter another MAFIL, who had climbed up the other side.
After descending a series of hairpins, I saw another MAFIL.</p>

<p>The clouds followed me for the rest of the ride. So did the warning of the food desert ahead. I did remember to ask the B&amp;B owner where I could hope to find food on the route, and they said it the M-village at km35 would be the only option.  Conveniently I arrived at a tiny village at 12h30, and there was indeed a little sandwich board pointing to a bar &amp; resto somewhere within.</p>

<p>The resto was empty aside from one other family. The waitress/boss seemed rather defensive when I asked if she was serving lunch, and explained it was a no-choice menu. Perfect. Meanwhile, from the whatsapp notifications I gathered  the rest of the gang was not finding many lunch options, but they would have been much further along, and, more critically, down.</p>

<p>I spent ages at lunch as was feeling really dispirited. Had a long venting conversation with K. Ate second helpings, lingered over blueberry pie &amp; coffee. While I was eating, my 3rd MAFIL of the day (Dutch or Belgian, this time) came in for a coffee. I think this was a record for spotting 40+ women cyclists on the trip - 4 of us on one road, wow!</p>

<p>More descending after lunch, and then I followed a narrow winding river valley for a bit. Hard day, my ass. There was 30s of hard climbing at the start of the a short &amp; gradual climb to the next col. It was still very cloudy so I couldn’t see too far below, but I did look at the surrounding mountains for signs of the Mediterranean. We’ve definitely left wall-to-wall spruce behind, and the vegetation maybe seemed rockier &amp; scrubbier. On the other hand, the remote-ness felt decidedly un-Mediterranean.</p>

<p>While looking at Google maps at lunch, I noticed a sizeable-looking village another 10k along the route. I asked the server if it’d be likely to have a pharmacy. She just laughed and laughed. “Il n y a rien. RIEN ! “  Nothing until Prades, she assured me.
It was another back-in-Canada moment, even without spruce trees.</p>

<p>There was another long gradual climb to the last col. It started to mist, and my mood matched the weather. Several times I stopped, not so much from tiredness but from grumpiness. But it did seem like we were approaching civilization: I was seeing more cyclists - or rather, I was getting passed by cyclists.</p>

<p>At the final col of the day, I took a little path for a nature break. Alas, I took my break a bit too close to a giant hill of red tenancious ants, so my descent was delayed by some frantic unzipping and flapping of garments.</p>

<p>Just as I was re-zipping in front of the col sign, another cyclist pops up and offers to take my pic by the sign. Turns out he’s German, also with a group (their van arrived while we were chatting). I ended up telling him my story of the day, and was very gratified that he was incensed on behalf of group-cyclists everywhere. “That is not a group! “ Had a quick sit inside their van to have a Kinder chocolate and meet the rest of his Fahrradgruppe. They offered me a lift down to the village of Mosset, where they were staying, but despite the mist I was keen to descend on the bike.</p>

<p>It was a good choice: the road was nice, and the weather cleared, revealing a most definitely Mediterranean landscape. At last! That was energizing. When I got to Mosset, I was sorely tempted to stay there for the night. It was small, and there was a auberge with a bar terrace had a lovely view. But I pressed on eventually, enjoying the easy descent on perfect, wide Girona-esque roads to Prades.</p>

<p>Got to hotel, met up with rest of gang, and said my piece to B and A: I’ve set off with you for 5 days, and on day 6 you took off without me. You should have done whatever it took to wake me up, and failing that, waited.</p>

<p>Then it was a mediocre dinner on an animated town square. B announced that we would leave and ride <em>together</em> for our last day.</p>

<p>Day 7</p>

<p>Prades to Collioure!</p>

<p>Yet another “what rock have you been living under?”-moment with P this morning: he was <em>very</em> surprised that a lot of keen amateur cyclists shave their legs.</p>

<p>After short stint on highway, we turned onto narrow little road that was a wonderful easy grade up for 20km. For the most part we were riding on the shady side of a river gorge, in perfect weather. After 10k we stopped at a little cafe (so V could have a breather). There was an old dude there, who upon seeing our group told the guys to be nice to the ladies. To which the guys snortingly replied that in our case the ladies were stronger than the guys!</p>

<p>It got marginally steeper after that, but that means some stretches of 4, 5, perhaps even 6% grades. I was alone for most of the ride: V’s love of humming and B’s love of chatting were harshing my mellow.</p>

<p>We reached what I thought was our last col of the trip. A few meters below, a view to the Med opened to the east. Woohoo! Then it was a descent on a road lined with olive trees. At an intersection, I ran into the German group from yesterday. In true German fashion, they were eating Mittagbrot on a folding table behind their van.</p>

<p>We, meanwhile, were hoping for an actual restaurant. There was another easy climb to the 2nd and last col, and soon after that was magic village with restaurant. Except apparently their Friday night had been too good, and they had no more food. There was another restaurant 4km down (everything was down by this point) the road.</p>

<p>All this downhill coasting was so fun we almost passed the restaurant sign without turning. It was a narrow road and didn’t look promising. I asked a couple in an oncoming car whether they thought the restaurant would be open. They said it looked likely, but warned me, “la cuisine est Catalane”, in the same way you’d say “too much sun causes skin cancer”.</p>

<p>I had nothing but happy memories of eating Catalan food, and this was no different. The food I’d say was a cut above the usual roadside fare we’d been eating. It even had an intriguingly-named <em>chariot de crudités, which turned out was a mini salad buffet on wheels with lots of salads that weren’t just _salade</em>.</p>

<p>V fell asleep during lunch.</p>

<p>We did an easy paceline after lunch, wanting to keep V with us. Then she took the lead and surged. LOL, classic.</p>

<p>Our route took us to the hilly, winding scenic road into Collioure. It was lovely. I couldn’t believe I’d managed to cycle 7 mountainous days in a row, particular with the first 5 days being quite challenging. And this after completing Etape du Tour a week prior. So maybe I wasn’t <em>quite</em> as prematurely-aged as I believed.</p>

<p>While I was feeling proud of myself, the overwhelming feeling was of relief: I finished, and hadn’t injured myself. Yes, I realize road cycling in general and bike-touring in particular are not known for causing injury. But hey, this is the woman who got a stress fracture training for an olympic-distance <em>triathlon</em> (read: a 2.5-3hr event that is 2/3 non-impact, and involves a measly 10k of running), and ruptured a disk while riding on gently rolling hills in Brittany.</p>

<p>In fact, this has been the first summer since 2014–when I joined a triathlon club with the goal of finally completing an olympic-distance triathlon–that I have not ended the summer with a serious sports injury. So what they say is true, folks: cycling is an joint-friendly way to build cardio. Just make sure your bike fits and be careful with your form on steep climbs.</p>
