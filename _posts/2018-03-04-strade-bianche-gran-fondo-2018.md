When I signed up for Etape du Tour last October–and the 28-week training plan that goes along with it–I knew a few interim cycling events would need to happen, to maintain training momentum and to get me used to negotiating mass starts and crowded roads.

Reading my friend Gerry's race report of Strade Bianche 2017 last March, with its epic black and white photos of rain-soaked, mud-encrusted riders, had stuck with me. The description was 139km, 1300m elevation gain. To date, my longest ride (which included lunch, coffee, & photo stops) was 138 km, so this seemed a very doable distance. All I wanted was to prove that I could survive riding the distance without a lunch break.

But it was also the same day as the Semi-marathon de Paris, a long-dreamed-for event with a course that passes within 200m of our apartment. I had been semi-seriously doing it, figuring the training would give me great aerobic fitness for EdT.  Then I learned that the odd sensation in my left groin was not another soft-tissue injury but early-stage hip arthritis. Suddenly the choice was easy: to Siena we would go (I registered my husband as well as myself)

Around 6 weeks into base training I uploaded the course GPX file into RidewithGPS: 2000m. A bit more than I bargained for (my long rides tend to be flat), but face it, the more elevation gain, the better for Etape.

In the month leading up to the race, the Beast from the East, aka Le Grand Froid descended, and I chose pain cave over HTFU. My vision of a series increasingly longer Sunday rides didn't quite pan out.

Then I read the fine print of the racing regs and saw there was a 7 hour cut-off. 7 hours from gun-time. Eeek.
